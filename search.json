In 2010, after relocating to Cambodia I started working as a consultant and contractor in the development sector. I have designed urban upgrading in informal settlements, small community centres. In Nepal I had the opportunity of being part of the post-earthquake response and reconstruction.\r\nIn 2018, I took an MSc in Environmental Engineering at Newcastle University to better understand the relationship between the built and the natural environment. I was part of research projects on water quality and environmental risk assessment. This was also a great opportunity to acquire a sharper work methodology and learn new tools for assessment and analysis.\r\nIn 2020 I have started working in the emergency sector as water, sanitation and habitat project manager. I have worked in Sudan (ICRC), Liberia and Malawi (MSF) mostly on health facilities infrastrucutre, water supply and emergency response.\r\nQuick links\r\nPortfolioCV development sectorCV private sectorLinkedin page\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In the past few years I have been involved in creating a serie of workshops and course titled Street Life Studies. Their focus is on the use of public street spaces in cities around the world.

I have organized and run courses on different topics related to construction and disaster preparedness. The key challenge in this type of activities is to find ways to communicate practical and theoretical knowledge to a wide and diverse audience. It is also essential to commmunicate the reasons behind guidelines and regulations so that workers do not only adopt them but understand their rationale.\r\nResearch\r\nI have worked as research assistant while at Newcastle University (09.2019 - 03.2021) in a research project focusing on water security.
